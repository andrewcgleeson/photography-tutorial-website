                <h1 class="leftCenter">Portrait Photography</h1>
                    <p>Portrait photography is a more intimate style of photography. The photographer must be comfortable with interacting with people in order to get the results they want. It is as much about <em>directing people</em> as it is camera technique. Great portrait photographers are often very charismatic, allowing their subjects to open up in front of the camera.</p>
                
                    <p>For examples of great portraiture, there are a number of famous photographers. Among them are names like Annie Liebowitz, Steve Curry and Dorothea Lange. One of the most well-known is <a href="https://www.stevemccurry.com/galleries" target="_blank">Steve McCurry</a>, known for his National Geographic photo "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Girl" target="_blank">Afghan Girl</a>".</p>

                        <h1>Show emotion</h1>
                        <p>Sometimes the most powerful portrait photos are ones that express true emotion. An emotionless subject is much less interesting than a subject full of emotion. When taking portraits, try getting your subject to show an emotion.

                        <h1>Give context</h1>
                        <p>If your subject is carrying out an action or looking at an object, make sure it is visible in your photo. This gives the viewer a better context of the scene in the photo. Someone staring intently at something off of the image never tells as compelling story as someone looking at something that is visible in the image.</p>

                        <h1>Frame your subject(s)</h1>
                        <p>Portrait photograpy is all about the subject. While it is possible to incorporate other elements into the photo, the focal point is the subject. As such, natural borders can help greatly when framing your subject as they draw the viewer's eye to the what is inside the "frame".</p>
