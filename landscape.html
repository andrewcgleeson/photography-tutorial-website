                    <p>While all types of photography are difficult in their own right, it could be argued that landscape photography is one of the most difficult types. Successful landscape photographers are the ones who are awake at 3am in Winter, hiking to a remote location to get one particular photo after days or weeks or sometimes <em>months</em> of planning.</p> 
                    
                    <p>A perfect example of this can be seen in the works of the Australian photographer Murray Fredericks who traveled to the salt flats in Bolivia <b>16 times</b> over the course of <b>8 years</b> to get the exact shots he wanted. You can see some of his work <a href="http://murrayfredericks.com/projects/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                        <h1>Leading Lines</h1>
                            <p>When looking at a photo, our eyes are particularly drawn to lines. They tend to guide the viewer's eye on where to look. They also help to frame a photo. When taking a landscape photo, try to frame it in such a way that the leading lines direct the viewer to the focal point.</p>

                        <h1>Golden Hour and Blue Hour</h1>
                            <p>The golden hour and blue hour are extremely popular in landscape photography. The golden hour refers to the hour <em>after</em> sunrise while the blue hour refers to the hour <em>before</em> sunset. These times of the day are ideal as the sun is low in the sky and the light emitted at that time is soft and low in contrast. This results in softer light and more appealing photos.</p>

                        <h1>Depth</h1>
                            <p>An issue that can occur in landscape photography is to do with the impression of scale. Photos are 2D images and sometimes depth can be lost in a photo. Often times it is recommended to have an object in the foreground to emphasize the size and scale of the landscape you are shooting.</p>
