                        <p>I have grouped both object and animal photography together because for the most part, they have similar requirements. To further clarify, I mean <em>small</em> objects and <em>small</em> animals. The reason for this is that they share one important characteristic: People normally look down at them! As such, we are used to seeing them from particular angle and a particular distance. One great way to immediately be able to take better photos is to shoot up close and low down.</p>
                        
                        <p>With regard to animals, both domestic and wild, one needs to be ready to shoot at a moments notice, as the best photo opportunities may be present for no more than a few seconds. This means prior planning and careful camera placement.</p>

                                <p>When taking photos, to give the object more character, try to shoot from its height. As humans, we are used to seeing objects from a top down angle. When you shoot from the objects own height, it takes on additional characteristics.</p>

                                <p>When possible try to shoot in the object's environment. Take photos of animals in more natural areas, as opposed to taking photos of them in urban areas. Or for example leather bags might be more suited to harsher climates <em>when possible!</em></p>

                                <p>A big part of animal/object photography is finding unique perspectives to photograph from. When possible, try to get as many different angles as you can. You may be surprised by the results!</p>
