                <h1>Photography Terminology</h1>
                    <p>Once one begins to frequent photography forums, watch photography videos or read books on photography, they will hit a wall of terminology. There are quite a number of terms commonly used in photography that one must know to understand what is being spoken about. Things like <i lang="ja">bokeh</i>, depth of field, timelapse, etc.</p>
                
                    <p>This is <em>not</em> an exhaustive list of terms, however it covers the vast majority of those used. For other terms not mentioned, they will normally come up on a case by case basis and so are not relevant for now. Many of the ones not mentioned are technical terms for example, <i>crop sensor</i> and <i>full-frame sensor</i> and relate to parts of the camera that are rarely important to know when starting out.</p>

                        <h1>Aspect Ratio</h1>
                            <p>The aspect ratio of an image is the propertional relationship between its width and its height. Normally this ratio is written as width:height, e.g. 16:9 which is the aspect ratio for most TVs and monitors. Some other commonly seen aspect ratios are 4:3, which was the original aspect ratio for TVs and subsequently point and click cameras, 3:2 for prosumer and professional level cameras which matches the original 35mm film cameras. Outside of these ratios exist a handful of others which are usually very niche. One which people are regularly exposed to without their knowledge is 2,35:1. This is the <i>animorphic</i> aspect ratio used with certain types of film cameras and is known for it's peculiar image properties. Some famous films shot in an animorphic aspect ratio are: </p>

                        <h1>Bokeh</h1>
                            <p><i>Bokeh</i> refers to the type of blur shape created when there is an out of focus section in an image. The shapes are different from lense to lense, but are usually circular in appearance. Older lenses with different styles of bokeh can often be highly sought after solely for this characteristic alone. This kind of feature is more prominent with lower F-Stop numbers and a larger distance between the foreground and background. It is also more noticeable when there are light sources in the background. The word itself comes from the japanese word <i lang="ja">boke (ぼけ)</i> meaning "blur" or "haze" and it is pronounced bo-<em>keh</em> or bo-<em>kay</em>.</p>

                        <h1>Depth Of Field</h1>
                        <p>Depth of field refers to the distance between the nearest and farthest objects that are in focus in an image. This is affected by many factors, however the primary contributers are the distance between your camera and your subject, your aperture and the focal length of your lense. One should avoid having too large a depth of field in images where it is not relevant, e.g. landscape photos highlighting the overall atmosphere.</p>

                        <h1>Focal Length</h1>
                            <p>The simplest way to describe focal length is to liken it to the zoom level of a camera lense. Focal length is normally measure in millimetres(mm) and commonly appear in the range of 35-70mm, while lenses outside of that range a primarily specialized for different uses. There also exists fixed length lenses called <i>prime lenses</i> which are usually cheaper and better quality but cannot zoom in or out.</p>

                        <h1>Exposure</h1>
                            <p>Exposure is the amount of light which is reaching your camera sensor. As with depth of field, exposure is affected by a variety of factors, key among them being the ambient light levels, the camera's shutter speed, aperture and ISO. An image that is too bright is referred to as <i>overexposed</i>, while an image that is too dark is referred to as <i>underexposed</i>. Usually it is recommended to correctly expose images, unless one has a specific goal in mind.</p>

                        <h1>Long Exposure Image</h1>
                            <p>A long exposure image is created by using leaving your camera's shutter open for a relatively long time (e.g. 1 or more seconds). Two things will happen, the camera will absorb more light resulting in a brighter image, as well as recording any light shifts over the time the shutter is open. An example of a long exposure can be seen above, where the light trails for the car are present across the photo.</p>

                        <h1>Noise</h1>
                            <p>Noise refers to the presence of tiny artifacts in an image, which is caused by a number of factors. The most common ones are a high ISO and long exposures. High ISO levels cause noise because the camera's sensor is artificially brightening the image as opposed to taking in more light. Long exposures create something called <i>thermal noise</i> because they cause the camera's sensor to heat up and the result is noise.</p>

                            <p>RAW files are the pure output taken from the camera. These are uncompressed and contain all of the visual data captured by the camera's sensor. These would be similar to MP3 and FLAC for audio files. RAW files are of much higher quality than JPEGs and much more detail can be recovered from them. In the image above, the left segment is a RAW edited file while the right segment is a JPG edited file. The difference is noticeable even in small images. While RAW has its advantages, the output could be anywhere up to five times bigger.</p>

A timelapse created from a group of pictures offers the photographer more flexibility in how the end product will look, as each image can be captured in a unique way before they are combined.</p>
